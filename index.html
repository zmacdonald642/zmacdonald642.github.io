	<b>Design Choices:</b> </br> <br></br>

	I added the white font color to the top headings, and created them using "th", therefore it automatically would bold the letters. I added the dark blue background color change to "tr" for the heading and the light blue to "tr" for the second row. Since all the cells needed to be centered for the second row, I added the alignment command to "tr" for the second row. On the other hand, the third row had centered data for only a few cells. So, I added the alignment individually for the cells that required it. The cells that did not have any data in them, I simply added empty data cells sequentially. To keep the "Total %" column narrow, I changed the width of this heading to 2%, so that even when the webpage is resized, as the table is designed to be reactive, the width of the "Total %" will stay the same, which helps add visual consistency. In the original table, the cells containing "Assignment" and "Due Date" are in the first row. In the table that I created, I wanted to center the headings in order to improve visual appearance of the table and to make the double solid colored cells look more fitted and efficient. As well, in contrast with the cells "Competencies" and the A-G cells, it looks sharp and tidy. I also assigned font size and type in order to closely match the example that was provided. To stretch or widen the blue heading, I used rowspan and colspan function to expand cell sizes.
