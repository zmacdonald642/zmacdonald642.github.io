	<b>Explain how and why:</b> </br> <br></br>

I first established a table with 9 columns and 5 rows. From here and filled in the necessary data provided. 
From here it was focusing on styling and configuration to match the look of the table provided. I did this all in HTML, but know that this would commonly be done in CSS. I added the white font color to the top headings, and created them using "th" to bold them as needed. I used a color sampler to retrieve the dark and light blue background colors and applied them to the appropriate cells as well adding a standard border around all cells. I assigned font size and type in order to closely match the example that was provided. To get the correct proportions I used rowspan and colspan function to expand cell sizes as needed.
Since all the cells needed to be centered for the second row, I added the alignment command to "tr" for the second row. The third row had centered data for only a few cells which required me to alignment them individually. The cells that did not have any data in them, I simply added empty data cells sequentially. 
The table is designed to be reactive to ensure device compatibility and the ability to magnify as needed. In the original table, the cells containing "Assignment" and "Due Date" are in the first row. In the table that I created, I wanted to center the headings in order to improve visual appearance of the table and to make the double solid colored cells look more fitted and efficient.

	<b>HTML Best Practices Applied to Online Learning:</b>

	<ul>
	<li>It can be used to create an efficient way of setting up meaningful tags for users to search and look up information. HTML is one of the easiest programming languages for creating search friendly webpages for users looking for certain information.
	<li>Images and graphics can be added easily without have to use flash or third party plugging and can used to effectively organize widgets and add semantic value to enhance user experience.
	<li>It is a platform that is accessible to nearly all devices and operating systems. Many users from students to staff use their cellphones and tablets to access their school material.
	<li>HTML has various means to accommodate accessibility to all users such as size scalability, text reader compatibility, keyboard only navigation and more.
